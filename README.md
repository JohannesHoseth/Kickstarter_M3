# Kickstarter_M3
Hi,

Predicting the next Kickstarter success, using a multi-modal model that combines categorical, textual and image data!

We're Katharina, Segiu and Johannes.

The Stakeholder report is written to explain the project focus, methods and results of the M3 group assignment. All code that has laid the ground for this report can be found in the notebooks. Four notebooks are attached, with this recommended reading order: (1) the Data Cleaning and Exploration notebook, (2) the Baseline Categorical, (3) the Baseline NLP, and (4) the cumulative Network Analysis Notebook.

The notebooks are uploaded as HTML, so download the whole reposatory, to get access to the rendered notebooks.
